# Price — `GET /v1/price`

A real price quote for one listing, for your dates and occupancy.

Quote one listing for specific dates and occupancy. Pass the platform-native platformListingId returned by /v1/search — numeric on Airbnb and Vrbo, a slug string on Booking.com and Google (e.g. "abramovic2") — or a full listing URL. The response is always a real numeric price or a typed error — never a wrong property's price.

## Example — vrbo

```bash
curl -s "https://api.scoutingapi.com/v1/v1/price" \
  -G \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCOUTINGAPI_KEY"
```

| `listingId` | query | string | Yes | Platform-native id from /v1/search platformListingId — numeric (Airbnb/Vrbo) or a slug string (Booking.com/Google). Or pass a url. |
| `checkIn` | query | date | Yes | YYYY-MM-DD; not in the past. |
