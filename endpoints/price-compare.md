# Price compare — `GET /v1/price-compare`

Cross-OTA price comparison for one property — the flagship endpoint.

Compare the price of one property across booking platforms in a single call, resolved through the Google Hotels backbone. The response carries the offers plus ScoutingAPI-computed min and median as first-class fields, so you can read the cheapest and typical cross-OTA price without re-deriving them. No cross-platform short-term-rental price-comparison API exists elsewhere — this is the wedge.

## Example — vrbo

```bash
curl -s "https://api.scoutingapi.com/v1/v1/price-compare" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode "location=Split, HR" \
  --data-urlencode "name=Vrbo Riva Apartment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCOUTINGAPI_KEY"
```

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | query | string | One of | Property name to resolve. |
| `googleHotelId` | query | string | One of | Precise Google Hotels id. |

| `checkIn` | query | date | Yes | YYYY-MM-DD; not in the past. |
